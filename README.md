# Project Overview

### Problem Statement
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

### Solution
The project is completed and has 7 test cases. There are a total of 4 test suites consisting of:
  - **RSS Feeds** : This is where we check whether the rss feeds are defined and have non-empty urls and names.
  - **The Menu** : Here we check that the menu is hidden by default and toggles on click of the menu icon.
  - **Initial Entries** : Here we check that the feed has atleast one entry on load.
  - **New Feed Selection** : When we select any new feed in the menu, the content of the feed is changed, that is what is tested here.

## Steps to Download
The solution can be downloaded using github clone/Download option or following the below steps.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/debatanu-thakur/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git

```
## Steps to run the app
```sh
$ cd frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
```
Open `index.html` in browser.
All the test cases run and pass.
